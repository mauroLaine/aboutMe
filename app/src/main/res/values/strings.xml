        This one of my favourites songs:
        [Verse 1]
        You know that it would be untrue
        You know that I would be a liar
        If I was to say to you
        Girl, we couldn\'t get much higher

        [Chorus]
        Come on baby, light my fire
        Come on baby, light my fire
        Try to set the night on fire

        [Verse 2]
        The time to hesitate is through
        No time to wallow in the mire
        Try now we can only lose
        And our love become a funeral pyre

        [Chorus]
        Come on baby, light my fire
        Come on baby, light my fire
        Try to set the night on fire
        Yeahâ€¦

        [Bridge]

        [Verse 2]
        The time to hesitate is through
        No time to wallow in the mire
        Try now we can only lose
        And our love become a funeral pyre

        [Chorus]
        Come on baby, light my fire
        Come on baby, light my fire
        Try to set the night on fire
        Yeah

        [Verse 1]
        You know that it would be untrue
        You know that I would be a liar
        If I was to say to you
        Girl, we couldn't get much higher

        [Chorus]
        Come on baby, light my fire
        Come on baby, light my fire
        Try to set the night on fire
        Try to set the night on fire
        Try to set the night on fire
        Try to set the night on fire
